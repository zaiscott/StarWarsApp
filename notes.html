    <li> Three divs for the sections; all planets, habitable, and Inhabitable. </li>

    <li> Gave selectors, class and id's, to the divs. </li>

    <li> Added a variable to be called in the onclick section header to display the names.</li>

    <li> Connect a variable, for all the planet info, to be onclicked into the name function so that all the planet information would be displayed.</li>

    <li> Inside the planet info variable, I appended lists for each selected piece of wanted data from the array, for example, names and terrain.</li>

    <li> Repeated the steps for each selection header for Inhabitable and Habitable, with the exeption of filters for planets with a population and unknown or zero.</li>
